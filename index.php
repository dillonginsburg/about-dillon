		<img src="ME.jpg">
		<p>Hello, my name is Dillon. I'm not great at writing about myself because I have spent <strong>a lot</strong> of time deconstructing my ego, and thus it feels as though there is not much to write. Here we go.</p>
		<p>Hikes, bikes, cars, stars, classical music, and an analog interpersonal style engulfed in digitality. Good food and better ingredients, low key, drama free, easy chillin.</p>
